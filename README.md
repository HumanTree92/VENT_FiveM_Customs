# [YMAP] FiveM & GTA V Custom Map Addons:
Custom Map Addons for FiveM - Made by Human Tree92 ([Velociti Entertainment Customs & Wiki](http://www.velocitientertainment.com/customs/))

# Helpfull Info:
* Check the README in V1 to learn more about it.
  * V1 is maps thats that i did a while back. Most of them where thrown together & where kinda unrealistic.
* Check the README in V2 to learn more about it.
  * V2 is pretty much upgraded versions of V1. I am going through them & cleaning them up & fixing things.
* I will not be uploading any pictures of the maps. I suggest to use CodeWalkers 3D Map Editor to View everything.
* Feel free to make changes but GIVE CREDITS if you plan on release edits of my work.
